# The-Weather-Application

The Weather app is a simple application that uses the [Open Weather Map](https://api.openweathermap.org) API to retrieve weather information, in this case I made use of temperature ( high/low ), humidity and windspeed. In the input field, you can enter a city name of your choice & click on ( View Weather Info) button to review weather info for that particular city. There is an option to view temperature in fahrenheit or celcius -- click on the checkbox to do that. You can see the app in action by visiting the live demo link below.
